# airbot



Hey! This bot is free to use. There are some restrictions though... You may NOT change the info command making it seem as if you created the bot. ALWAYS give credit and ALWAYS keep the creator's name on it. 




To get started, download or clone this repository and then go to config.json and get your application's token. You can do this by going to the discord developer bot portal (https://discordapp.com/developers/applications/) and click on **New Application**. Type in the name you wish and on the left, there will be a sidebar which has **General Information, Oauth2, Bot, Rich Presence, and App Whitelist**. You want to click on **Bot** and then click on **Add Bot**. You can configure it in whatever way you wish. Under **Token**, press **Copy**. DO **NOT** SHARE THIS WITH ANYONE. ANYONE WHO HAS THIS TOKEN CAN DO WHATEVER THEY WANT WITH YOUR APPLICATION. Once you copy it, go back to config.json and paste it where it says:
```
"token": "TOKENHERE"
```
